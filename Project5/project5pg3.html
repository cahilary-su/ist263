    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>There are a lot of different teams and organizations within the esports industry, most titles separated by geological orientation for their regular season before they have a big tournament called the worlds or the grand finals where the top teams gather and compete to see who is the best.  The regions that compete in most titles are North America, Asia, Latin America, European teams and lots of other teams.
