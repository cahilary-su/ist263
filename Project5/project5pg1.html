    <h2>ESPORTS HISTORY</h2>

    <p>There has been a lot of talk in the news and media in the past few years about the term Esports.  You may be asking yourself what esports is?  Esports is a multiplayer video game played competitively for spectators, typically by professional gamers.</p>

    <p> Before we get into what esports is in today's world, let's talk about where esports started.  Esports started around 1972 but the first competitive tournament wasn't until 1980 with a game called space invaders. </p>

    <p>The first televised Esports event happened in 2006, Halo 2 at this time broadcasting of esports was hard because a lot of licensing and media rights the publishers put in place. So in 2014, Amazon bought Twitch. (Twitch is a streaming service where people can watch esports and content creators alike). 
    In 2011, League of Legends had its first World Championship and in 2013, the event sold out the Staples Center in Los Angeles within minutes of tickets going on sale.
